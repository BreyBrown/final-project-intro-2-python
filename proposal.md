# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Dungeon Dangers (Working Title)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A text based adventure game in which you explore an abandoned dungeon. The first build would only have the exploration aspect, but a combat system would be implemented later down the line.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This text-based adventure game is just that, a game. It would present players with choices, what they could do in a situation, but it's up to them to figure it out from that point. Players would explore a dark, cryptic dungeon and progress through it with the use of items and actions. There will be choices that can end the game instantly, and much like the games of the older days this will send you back to the start. However these choices are completely optional, and should speak out to reason with the player.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A system of multiple rooms that can be freely explored, and to have a basic, functioning item system; as well as bare minimum functions for actions: go/look left, go/look right, go/look up, go/look down, pick up[blank], use [blank]. 
These items would simply be like 'keys' that are needed to progress certain areas and can be obtained through the pick up function.
Add choices that can result in the game ending. ex: "You go down the pit... and continue to plummet towards the bottom. In the back of your mind you wonder why you chose to do such a thing, and your adventure ends abruptly."

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A system of functions that allow different choices of how to proceed with roadblocks.
A rough list of these added actions for an early build would be: push, pull, break, drink, climb.
If an action would not work in a stituation it will prompt the player with a message such as, "You attempt to [blank], but to no avail."

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To have a fully functional system of explorable rooms with detailed descriptions for each.
A fully fleshed out item and action system with as much variety as possible in how you can proceed.
Sometimes approaching situations the wrong way can deal damage to you. (Too much damage results in the game ending & sending the player back to the start.)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to work with strings, dictionaries, if/while statements, for loops, and functions. Overall I want to be as detailed and precise as possible so that I do not confuse the player, but I should also explain my code in ways that if someone were to look at it, they would understand what's going on. In an early build I won't implement a combat system as I feel that could be a bit too much to add onto the work I'd already need to do, though I intend to continue this project afterwards, and would like to implement more mathmatics into my code. My next step right now would be to look at other text-based adventure games and see how they handle the settings they provide, how do they prompt the player with what is possible and what is not. Overall I need to learn more on if/while statements and dictionaries as I have struggled with them in the past. There is also the matter of what programming language I'd need to use in order to make this project work, in the case that I must learn something other than python in order to accomplish this goal.
