# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The main idea I have for my final project involve working on a text-based adventure game. Much like an old DOS text-based game.

Pong but the ball is a letter that changes speed, score, and the letter the more you bounce it back and forth. A:1 - Z:27.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working solo on this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

None.
