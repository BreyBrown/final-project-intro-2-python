# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The main idea I have for my final project involve working on a text-based adventure game, which would involve putting your name, selecting a class and exploring a dungeon through the use of detailed descriptions. I would like to implement 3 classes, and a small combat system that would see use occassionally throughout the first portion of the game. This is a LITE varient of my idea, and I'd like to even out the exploration and combat, so the enemies will be simple and reusable at first. My idea stems from the early DOS text-based games.

Pong but the ball is a letter that changes speed, score, and the letter the more you bounce it back and forth. A:1 - Z:27.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working solo on this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How often should my main project rely on self-made functions?
Would you recommend writing a function for each zone? I intend to implement at least 20 different rooms, at least 4 of which will have nothing and are purely for you to progress.
Items you collect will also be functions, and are required to move forward through specific zones.
