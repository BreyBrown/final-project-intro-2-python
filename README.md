# final-project-intro-2-python

##main idea proposal

The main idea I have for my final project involve working on a text-based adventure game, which would involve putting your name, selecting a class and exploring a dungeon through the use of detailed descriptions. I would like to implement 3 classes, and a small combat system that would see use occassionally throughout the first portion of the game. This is a LITE varient of my idea, and I'd like to even out the exploration and combat, so the enemies will be simple and reusable at first. My idea stems from the early DOS text-based games.

##back up ideas

Pong but the ball is a letter that changes speed, score, and the letter the more you bounce it back and forth. A:1 - Z:27.
